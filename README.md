# Æ.O.N: The Analytical Engine of Origin and Narrative

**Æ.O.N is a hybrid linguistic simulation environment combining academic-grade language evolution modeling, creative worldbuilding tools, and a fully integrated offline AI ecosystem.**  
This repository serves as a **showcase, documentation hub, and branding archive** for AEON.

The full application is available on itch.io → [Æ.O.N: The Analytical Engine of Origin and Narrative](https://malloway.itch.io/aeon)

## 🧭 What is Æ.O.N?
Æ.O.N is a **linguistic simulation and reconstruction engine** designed to model how languages evolve, fracture, and preserve memory across generations in both **real historical contexts** and **speculative futures**.

It blends:

- **Professional software engineering** (Unity 6, Python, KoboldCPP, Stable Diffusion, Piper tts)
- **Academic linguistic methodology** (sound change, grammar drift, proto-form reconstruction)
- **Speculative simulation** (Martian English, feline semiotic drift, ritual fossilization)

Æ.O.N functions as:

- A **research tool**  
- A **creative worldbuilding platform**  
- A **cultural preservation aid**  
- A **forward-linguistics simulation environment**  

---

## ⚙️ Architecture Overview
Æ.O.N uses a modular engine governed by a **Symbolic Router** that dynamically activates relevant subsystems based on user input.

### 🧩 Core Linguistic Modules
| Module | Purpose |
|--------|----------|
| **Phoneme Drift Engine** | Simulates attested cross-linguistic sound changes over generational timelines. |
| **Morphology Chain Logic** | Models morphological erosion, fusion, affix drift, and analogical reformation. |
| **Syntax Evolution Ruleset** | Tracks grammar drift, word-order changes, clause collapse, and grammaticalization. |
| **Prosody & Tonal System** | Handles stress, meter, cadence, tonal evolution, and chant-aligned drift patterns. |
| **Ritual Fossilization Engine** | Preserves archaic forms in ceremonial, symbolic, or mnemonic speech domains. |
| **Artifact Influence Engine** | Evaluates how writing systems, media, and material culture stabilize or mutate language. |
| **Diaspora & Trauma Drift Engine** | Simulates crisis-accelerated divergence, displacement-driven simplification, and trauma-pressure drift. |
| **Root Fossil Reintegration** | Validates reconstructed proto-forms using typology, phonotactics, and preservation models. |
| **Historical Backtrace Mode** | Reverse-engineers modern fragments back into proto-forms or unattested ancestral stages. |
| **Corpus Coherence Engine** | Aligns simulated languages with real linguistic corpora and typological universals. |
| **Export & Ethnographic Format Engine** | Generates academic, narrative, or simplified outputs with glossing and metadata options. |
| **Taboo & Information Suppression Engine** | Models taboo domains, semantic voiding, euphemistic drift, and symbolic fossilization. |
| **Lost Word Backtrace Mode** | Reconstructs missing lexemes from partial fossils, symbols, or phonemic residues. |
| **Diaspora & Trauma Dialects Model** | Simulates dialect fragmentation, symbolic residue formation, and contact instability. |
| **Ethnographic / Academic Export Engine** | Structures outputs for research-grade exports, corpus logs, or simplified public formats. |
| **Root Fossil Reintegration Engine** | Performs post-simulation proto-form validation using CRI/MV/SC metrics. |
| **Real-Time Corpus Integration Engine** | Performs API-level corpus checks and matches simulated roots to attested data. |
| **Generic Corpus Validation Framework** | Applies cross-linguistic corpus scans and typological benchmarks for plausibility. |
| **Field Linguist Validation Checkliste** | Provides a field-linguist-style validation pass: phonemic, semantic, syntactic, prosodic checks. |
| **Corpus Match Seed Set** | Provides pre-mapped proto-root → corpus-attested cognate anchors for reconstruction grounding. |

All 20 modules are fully integrated into Æ.O.N’s runtime environment.
