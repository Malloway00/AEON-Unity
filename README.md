## 🧭 What is ÆON?
ÆON is a **linguistic simulation and reconstruction engine** designed to model how languages evolve, fracture, and preserve memory across generations in both **real historical contexts** and **speculative futures**.

It blends:

- **Professional software engineering** (Unity 6, Python, KoboldCPP, Stable Diffusion)
- **Academic linguistic methodology** (sound change, grammar drift, proto-form reconstruction)
- **Speculative simulation** (Martian English, feline semiotic drift, ritual fossilization)

ÆON functions as:

- A **research tool**  
- A **creative worldbuilding platform**  
- A **cultural preservation aid**  
- A **forward-linguistics simulation environment**

## ⚙️ Architecture Overview
ÆON uses a modular engine governed by a **Symbolic Router** that dynamically activates relevant subsystems based on user input.

### 🧩 Core Linguistic Modules
| Module | Purpose |
|--------|----------|
| **Phoneme Drift Engine** | Simulates attested cross-linguistic sound changes over generational timelines. |
| **Morphology Chain Logic** | Models morphological erosion, fusion, and analogical reformation. |
| **Syntax Evolution Ruleset** | Tracks grammar drift, word-order changes, and grammaticalization patterns. |
| **Prosody & Tonal System** | Handles stress, meter, and tonal evolution across dialect splits. |
| **Ritual Fossilization Engine** | Preserves archaic forms in ceremonial and mnemonic speech domains. |
| **Artifact Influence Engine** | Evaluates how writing systems and material culture stabilize language. |
| **Diaspora & Trauma Drift Engine** | Simulates crisis-accelerated divergence and dialect fragmentation. |
| **Root Fossil Reintegration** | Validates reconstructed proto-forms against typological plausibility. |
| **Historical Backtrace Mode** | Reverse-engineers modern fragments to proto-forms using comparative method. |
| **Corpus Coherence Engine** | Aligns generated languages with established linguistic databases. |

All 17 modules are fully integrated into ÆON’s runtime environment.

## 🧠 AI Integration
ÆON incorporates **both offline and online AI systems**:

- **Local LLM Backend** (KoboldCPP, `.gguf`)  
- **Stable Diffusion Backend** (local Python environment)  
- **Cloud AI Fallback** (OpenRouter and compatible endpoints)  
- **Automatic Module Routing** using tag-based context detection  
- **Thread-Safe Subprocess Manager** for all AI tasks  

ÆON includes a complete offline stack so users can run everything **without internet access**.

## 📚 AEON Showcases (Academic + Speculative Studies)
AEON includes a curated library of **linguistic case studies** demonstrating real and imagined evolution:

### 🧬 Academic / Historical
- **Beringian Lineage Recovery**: Reconstruction of a fragmented Alaskan-Yupik cluster.  
- **Gaelic Diaspora Backtrace**: Reverse-time reconstruction of diaspora dialects.  
- **Proto-Indo-European Root Study**: Comparative simulation across 10 daughter branches.  
- **Dene–Yeniseian Reintegration Test**: Evaluating cross-continental cognate plausibility.

### 🚀 Speculative / Forward-Linguistic
- **Martian Dialect Evolution (2025–2175)**: Trajectory of “Soltok,” a Martian-English offshoot.  
- **Felis domesticus Semiotic Drift (2025–3000)**: Cross-species semiotic expansion toward a feline–human pidgin.  
- **Ritual Backtrace Simulation**: Fossilized ceremonial syntax under extreme time depth.

Each showcase contains:
