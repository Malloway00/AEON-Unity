## 🧭 Overview
ÆON is a fully interactive **linguistic simulation system** designed to model how languages evolve, fracture, and preserve memory across time.  
It combines **academic linguistics**, **AI integration**, and **Unity-based visualization** to simulate the evolution of phonology, morphology, syntax, and cultural context across generations.

ÆON treats language as a living system—one shaped by trauma, ritual, diaspora, and environmental change.  
It serves as both a **research-grade tool** and an **experiential simulation engine** for creative and heritage applications.

## ⚙️ System Architecture
ÆON’s internal structure follows a modular design:

| Module | Function |
|---------|-----------|
| **Phoneme Drift Engine** | Simulates attested sound changes across generations using natural phonetic tendencies. |
| **Morphology Chain Logic** | Models morphological decay, fusion, and analogical reshaping. |
| **Syntax Evolution Ruleset** | Simulates syntactic drift, grammaticalization, and word-order change. |
| **Prosody & Meter System** | Handles stress, rhythm, and tonal evolution. |
| **Ritual Fossilization Engine** | Preserves archaic forms found in ceremonial or mnemonic speech. |
| **Artifact Influence Engine** | Examines how writing systems and cultural tools stabilize language. |
| **Diaspora & Trauma Dialect Engine** | Simulates accelerated change under migration and crisis. |
| **Root Fossil Reintegration Engine** | Validates reconstructed proto-forms for plausibility. |
| **Historical Reconstruction Mode** | Reverses modern fragments to proto-forms using comparative principles. |
| **Real-Time Corpus Integration** | Aligns simulations with existing linguistic data for coherence. |

Each module communicates through a **Symbolic Router** and **Tag Database**, allowing ÆON to interpret user input and apply relevant pressures dynamically.

## 🧠 AI & Local Integration
ÆON operates with both **online and offline intelligence**:

- **Local LLM Backend:** integrates with *koboldcpp* models (`.gguf`) through a lightweight router.  
  _[Local model placeholder link — coming soon]_  
- **Stable Diffusion Backend:** local image generation for symbolic, academic, or illustrative outputs.  
  _[Local SD model placeholder link — coming soon]_  
- **Fallback System:** automatic switch to online LLMs (OpenRouter, etc.) when offline backends fail.  
- **All subprocesses** are safely managed and logged through dedicated thread handlers.

## 🎨 Interface & Experience
- **Professional splash screen and golden seal branding**  
- **Cross-platform builds** for Windows, macOS, and Linux  
- **Thread-safe subprocess management**
- **Automatic log and image archive structure:**

## 🌍 Core Values & Philosophy
- **Cultural Preservation:** Language recovery is a shared human right. ÆON provides free access to heritage and revitalization communities.  
- **Academic Accessibility:** Research and understanding should never be gatekept; the outputs and processes of ÆON are documented and shareable.  
- **Ethical Sustainability:** Fair, value-based pricing ensures the project can continue without exploitation or corporate ownership.  
- **Responsible Stewardship:** Core systems remain protected to preserve integrity and prevent misuse, while linguistic results and methodologies remain accessible.  
- **Technical Integrity:** Every build is maintained to professional and cultural standards of accuracy.

ÆON is not just a product—it’s a **continuing effort to preserve linguistic memory through technology.**
