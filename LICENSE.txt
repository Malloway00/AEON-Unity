LangMind v1.3 License & Usage Terms

LangMind was developed by **Devin Barrett**

All core modules—including the Phonological Drift Simulation Engine,  
Lexical & Semantic Drift Tracker, Syntactic Fossils Analysis Module,  
Chant Reconstruction & Prosody Module, and Linguistic Plausibility Metrics—  
are fully owned and maintained by the creator.

This system is shared for symbolic experimentation and linguistic reconstruction  
via GPT-powered interaction. All rights to its recursive logic, structure,  
and naming conventions are reserved.

🧠 System Use Rights (via GPT):  
✅ You may simulate linguistic drift and participate in LangMind evolution  
✅ You may explore generational changes, ritual syntax, or phonemic compression  
✅ You may build cultural narratives using the tools LangMind exposes  

🚫 Limitations (unless otherwise authorized):  
❌ You may not reuse the name "LangMind" or its recursive branding for derivative GPTs  
❌ You may not extract or republish internal module files or symbolic frameworks  
❌ You may not reverse-engineer or commercialize derivative GPTs based on LangMind without consent

educational, museum, tribal, or scholarly platforms,  
please contact **Devin Barrett** for appropriate licensing terms.
