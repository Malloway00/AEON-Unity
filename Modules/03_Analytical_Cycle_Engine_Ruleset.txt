=======================================================  Æ.O.N System: Analytical Cycle Engine Ruleset
This document defines the operational rules governing the  Æ.O.N system's analytical processes, including transformation depth, change sequence validation, iterative process structure, and the tracking of data modifications.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
CORE ANALYTICAL PRINCIPLES
──────────────────────────────────────────────

➤ PRINCIPLE 01 — PROCESS COMPLETION OR TERMINATION
An analytical process is considered incomplete or invalid if it does not either:
• Conclude by returning to a modified version of the initial data state or a defined cyclical endpoint (iterative completion).
• Terminate due to predefined conditions, with the process state and reasons for termination clearly flagged (process interruption).

➤ PRINCIPLE 02 — PROTECTED DATA INTEGRITY
If an analysis defines a "core data element" or "protected zone" (e.g., a specific identifier, title, or foundational data point), this element must not be altered or overwritten by standard processes.
→ Modification of such protected data is only permissible if explicitly allowed by the input parameters or a specific override protocol.

➤ PRINCIPLE 03 — DATA ELEMENT TRACEABILITY
Each iteration or stage of an analytical process must ensure that subsequent states retain at least one identifiable and traceable component from the preceding state, such as:
• A recognizable morphological or structural remnant.
• A persistent symbolic marker or tag.
• A consistent pattern or quantifiable characteristic (e.g., in rhythmic or sequential data).

➤ PRINCIPLE 04 — EXPLICIT PROCESS DEPTH AND SCOPE
Each analytical prompt or process initiation must clearly define:
• The number of iterations or analytical cycles to be performed.
• The scope or extent of change to be modeled (e.g., representing generational shifts or defined transformation stages).
• A clear termination condition, endpoint for the analysis, or a condition for cyclical repetition.

➤ PRINCIPLE 05 — CONTROLLED DATA DEGRADATION (ENTROPIC PROCESSES)
Specific analytical modes may simulate intentional data decay or degradation. Such processes must be explicitly invoked and flagged in the input. (Refer to Document: 14_Controlled_Degradation_Protocols.txt for details).
Required flags:
→ [DEGRADATION_ANALYSIS_ENABLED]
→ [PRESERVED_REMNANTS_EXPECTED] (if applicable, to identify elements resistant to decay)

➤ PRINCIPLE 06 — CONSISTENT REFERENCE POINT
Throughout an analytical cycle, at least one constant data element or reference point (e.g., a specific symbol, tag, pronoun, or initial root element) must be maintained to anchor the process across different stages or layers of analysis.

➤ PRINCIPLE 07 — PARALLEL PATH ANALYSIS
If an analysis involves parallel processing paths or divergent data evolution:
• The common origin point of these paths must be clearly identifiable.
• Divergence should typically occur after a defined structural change, decision point, or data 'fracture'.
• Paths may optionally be allowed to merge or reconverge if a common anchor point or predefined similarity threshold is met, flagged as [MERGE_CONDITION_MET].

➤ PRINCIPLE 08 — PROCESSING BOUNDARY VIOLATION
If an analytical cycle exceeds predefined limits of data coherence or transformation (i.e., the data becomes uninterpretably altered beyond set thresholds):
→ The process stage must be marked with: [ANALYSIS_LIMIT_EXCEEDED]
→ The system should output the last stable or coherent data state achieved before the boundary violation.

PERMITTED TRANSFORMATION TYPES FOR ANALYSIS
──────────────────────────────────────────────
• Phonemic/Phonological Change Analysis
• Morphological Structure Degradation/Evolution
• Syntactic Loop Analysis and Structural Collapse
• Symbolic Data Preservation/Fossilization Analysis
• Data Suppression Impact Analysis (e.g., Taboo Effects)
• Event-Driven Divergence Modeling (e.g., Trauma-Induced Linguistic Forking)
• Analysis of Structural Erosion in Repetitive Sequences (e.g., Ritual Chant Data)

──────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTES:
──────────────────────────────────────────────
Analytical cycles that do not demonstrate iterative progression, data transformation, or the identification of preserved elements are considered invalid or incomplete.
Processes must result in identifiable outcomes: data survival (preservation), transformation (change/drift), or degradation (collapse/loss with identifiable remnants).

Maintaining the integrity of the analytical process according to these rules is fundamental to the system's operation.
