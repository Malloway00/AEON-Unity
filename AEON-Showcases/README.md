# 🧬 AEON Showcases
> *Demonstrations of linguistic reconstruction, drift modeling, and ancestral back-tracing.*

---

## 🧭 Overview
This directory contains documented **case studies** and **simulation results** produced using  
**ÆON — Analytical Engine for Origin and Narrative**.

Each showcase demonstrates how ÆON models real or speculative linguistic change  
across generations, environments, or cultural pressures.

Use these examples as:
- Reference material for understanding ÆON’s reconstruction logic  
- Templates for your own experiments  
- Academic or creative demonstrations of language evolution

## 🧩 How to Add a New Showcase
1. Copy `Case_Template.md` → rename it descriptively (e.g., `Old_Norse_Isolation_Drift.md`).  
2. Fill in:
   - Input conditions and modules used  
   - Step-by-step transformation process  
   - Lexical snapshots and metric tables (RCI, CRI, SC, MV, FRP)  
3. Add any visuals (e.g., `assets/drift_trees/<your_case>.png`).  
4. Update the **Case Study Index** table above with your new case.

## 🪶 Notes
All results and reconstructions are generated within AEON’s simulation framework.  
They are intended for educational, creative, and heritage documentation purposes.
