# 🧬 AEON Showcases
> *Demonstrations of linguistic reconstruction, drift modeling, and ancestral back-tracing.*

---

## 🧭 Overview
This directory contains documented **case studies**, **educational exports**, and **simulation results** produced using  
**ÆON — Analytical Engine for Origin and Narrative**.

Each showcase demonstrates how ÆON models real or speculative linguistic change  
across generations, environments, or cultural pressures.

Use these examples as:
- Reference material for understanding ÆON’s reconstruction logic  
- Templates for your own experiments  
- Academic or creative demonstrations of language evolution  
- Educational artifacts for heritage and classroom use  

> For simplified and outreach-ready versions, see [**ÆON-Showcases/Education →**](Education/)

## 🖼️ Visual Thumbnails

A quick look at the reconstructed language lineages and drift trees generated by AEON:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/drift_trees/Gaelic_Lineage_Visual.png" width="300" alt="Gaelic Drift Tree"/>
  <img src="assets/drift_trees/PIE_Root_ḱerd_Drift_Visual.png" width="300" alt="PIE Root Drift Map"/>
</p>

Each image represents a **simulated evolutionary path** between reconstructed roots and their modern descendants.  
Full-resolution versions are stored in `assets/drift_trees/`.

## 🧩 How to Add a New Showcase
1. Copy `Case_Template.md` → rename it descriptively (e.g., `Old_Norse_Isolation_Drift.md`).  
2. Fill in:
   - Input conditions and modules used  
   - Step-by-step transformation process  
   - Lexical snapshots and metric tables (RCI, CRI, SC, MV, FRP)  
3. Add any visuals (e.g., `assets/drift_trees/<your_case>.png`).  
4. Update the **Case Study Index** table above with both your research and educational versions.  
5. For outreach or learning-focused exports, save them under `AEON-Showcases/Education/`.

## 🎓 Educational / Community Mode

**AEON’s Educational Mode** reinterprets case data into simplified, story-driven, and visually accessible versions for outreach, classrooms, or heritage projects.  

Each educational export includes:
- Simplified metrics with emoji visual guides  
- Cultural and emotional context  
- Timeline-based tables and drift maps  
- Quotes and summaries from AEON Ethnographic Logs  

These files are automatically formatted using **Module 15: Export & Ethnographic Format**, ensuring clarity and accessibility while preserving accuracy.

## 🪶 Notes
All results and reconstructions are generated within AEON’s simulation framework.  
They are intended for educational, creative, and heritage documentation purposes.
