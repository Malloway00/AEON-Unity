# Æ.O.N Showcases  
**Curated Linguistic Simulations • Academic + Speculative Modules**

This directory contains the full library of **Æ.O.N** showcase studies.  
Each entry demonstrates how the engine’s 20 linguistic subsystems behave when applied to real historical data, speculative futures, and symbolic fossilization contexts.

All showcases include:
- Module routing metadata  
- Time-depth modeling  
- Phonological + morphological outputs  
- Glossed examples  
- Exportable academic-style reports  
- Source logs generated directly from the engine

# 📄 Case Template
Use `Case_Template.md` as a starter format for new studies.  
It standardizes:
- Metadata  
- Required outputs  
- Glossing style  
- Export blocks  
- Module-activation notes

# 🧭 Purpose of This Library
- Demonstrate ÆON’s academic-grade reconstruction capabilities  
- Provide examples for writers, researchers, and linguists  
- Archive reproducible experiments for reference and teaching  
- Serve as a public-facing gallery of what the engine can generate  

Each showcase is fully reproducible inside the main application.
