## 🧠 Analysis Summary
**Observed Trends:**  
[Summarize the major changes observed — sound shifts, morphological collapses, etc.]

**Linguistic Insight:**  
[Explain what this result reveals about the evolution of the language or phrase.]

**Validity:**  
[Provide interpretation of your RCI/CRI pair — e.g., “Strong reverse coherence with minor contextual loss.”]

## 🪶 Notes & Future Work
- [Example: Re-run using **Trauma Drift** to model colonial impact]  
- [Example: Test same root under **Multi-Contact Drift** with neighboring dialects]  
- [Example: Incorporate **Prosody & Meter System** to assess rhythmic fossilization]
