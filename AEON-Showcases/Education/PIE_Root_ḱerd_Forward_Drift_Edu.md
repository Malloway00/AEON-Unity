# 🧬 AEON Educational Showcase — PIE Root *ḱerd-* Forward Drift  
*How one ancient word for “heart” became hundreds of words across time.*

---

## 💬 Overview
This study uses **ÆON — the Analytical Engine for Origin and Narrative** — to follow the Proto-Indo-European root **`*ḱerd-*`**, meaning *“heart”*, as it evolves forward through 6,000 years of linguistic history.  
From a single root, entire families of words emerged: Irish *croí*, Latin *cor*, Greek *kardía*, English *heart*, and Sanskrit *hṛdaya*.

ÆON models how this root traveled across continents and cultures — shifting its sound but never its meaning.

## 🌍 Branchwise Evolution

| Branch | Proto Stage | Classical / Medieval Reflex | Modern Reflex | Key Shift Summary | Modules | FRP |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Celtic** | *kridyom* | OIr *cride* | Ir *croí*, G *cridhe* | Centum merger (ḱ>k); diphthong loss; ritual fossilization | Phoneme Drift, Ritual Fossilization | 0.60 |
| **Italic / Romance** | *cord-* | Lat *cor, cordis* | It *cuore*, Fr *cœur*, Sp *corazón* | Stable O-grade ablaut; strong literary retention | Artifact Influence | 0.75 |
| **Greek** | *kardiā* | *καρδία* | *καρδιά* | Retained cluster [kr]; preserved medical/poetic register | Syntax Evolution, Artifact Influence | 0.75 |
| **Germanic** | *hertōn-* | OE *heorte* | Eng *heart*, Ger *Herz* | Grimm’s Law (ḱ>h, d>t); maintained core semantics | Phoneme Drift, Syntax Evolution | 0.60 |
| **Indo-Aryan** | *hṛd-, hṛdaya* | Skt *hṛd*, *hṛdaya* | Hi *hṛday*, Ben *hridoy* | Satem shift (ḱ>ś>h); partial replacement by *dil* | Diaspora & Trauma Dialects, Corpus Validation | 0.55 |

## 🔡 Phoneme Drift Summary

### 🌀 Major Shifts
- **Centum branches:** ḱ → k (Celtic, Latin, Greek)  
- **Germanic:** ḱ → h; d → t (Grimm’s Law)  
- **Satem branches:** ḱ → ś → h (Sanskrit)

### 🔍 Retention Index

| Transition | Retention (RI) |
|-------------|----------------|
| PIE → Proto-Branch | 0.78 |
| Proto → Classical | 0.72 |
| Classical → Modern | 0.60 |

Average change rate: **0.55 (moderate divergence)**  
Consonant skeleton (K/H–R–D) persists in all branches.

---

## 🧩 Morphology & Syntax Drift

- PIE flexible syntax → early branches developed stable nominative systems.  
- Later simplification into analytic expressions (e.g., “from my heart”).  
- Productive derivations: *cordial*, *cardiac*, *heartfelt*, *hṛdaya-vān* (“heartful”).  
- **Morphological Validity (MV): 0.80** — strong across all classical branches.

---

## 🪶 Artifact Influence
- **Greek & Latin:** Preserved cardio-/cordi- as scholarly roots.  
- **Celtic & Germanic:** Conserved in idioms and cultural proverbs.  
- **Indo-Aryan:** Retained in liturgical use despite vernacular replacements.  
- **Influence Score:** High — literary and religious use stabilized ancient forms.

---

## 🌍 Diaspora & Trauma Dialects
Migration, conquest, and cultural trauma changed pronunciations — but the emotional weight of *“heart”* made the word nearly impossible to erase.

- **Celtic:** Survived colonization; deeply tied to poetic identity.  
- **Germanic:** Spread through migration; foundational emotional term.  
- **Indo-Aryan:** Maintained sacred presence (*hṛdaya*) though replaced in speech (*dil*).  
- **Retention Level:** 0.65 (partial fossilization, high semantic stability)

## 🧠 Summary
From Proto-Indo-European **`*ḱerd-*`** to words like *croí, cor, καρδία, heart, hṛdaya* — every major branch of the Indo-European family preserves the same meaning: *the emotional and physical center of life.*

Across millennia, while sounds drifted, the word’s **essence never changed.**  
Even today, *heart* remains a metaphor for love, courage, and identity — living proof of how deeply language remembers.
