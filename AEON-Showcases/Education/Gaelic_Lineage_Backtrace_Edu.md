# 🌿 AEON Educational Showcase — Gaelic Lineage Backtrace
> *How the Irish phrase “Mo chroí” (“My heart”) remembers its ancient ancestor.*

## 💬 What Are We Studying?

This study uses **AEON** — a linguistic simulation system — to look *backward in time* at how a modern Irish phrase has changed across thousands of years.  

The phrase **“Mo chroí”** means “my heart.”  
AEON traces how its sound and structure evolved all the way back to **Proto-Celtic**, and even to the earliest Indo-European root *ḱerd-* — the same root that gave us words like *corazón* (Spanish), *cœur* (French), and *heart* (English).

## 🔡 Step-by-Step Timeline

| Time Period | Language Stage | Example Form | Pronounced | Key Change |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| 21st c. | Modern Irish | **Mo chroí** | [mˠo xɾˠiː] | Soft “ch” sound replaces old “k” |
| 10th c. | Old Irish | **Mo cride** | [mo krʲiðʲe] | Lost final vowel, sound simplified |
| 5th c. | Primitive Irish | **Mo kride** | [mo kridʲe] | “K” sound returns before lenition |
| ~1000 BCE | Proto-Celtic | **\*krediyom** | [ˈkredijom] | Early ancestor, before Irish split |
| ~4000 BCE | Proto-Indo-European | **\*ḱerd-** | [kʲerd] | Original root meaning “heart” |

## 🔍 What Changed?

🌀 **Sound (Phonology):**  
/k/ softened to [x] (“ch”) over time — a common Gaelic lenition.  

🧱 **Word Shape (Morphology):**  
Endings and vowels were gradually dropped as the phrase was spoken faster and more emotionally.  

🕯️ **Cultural Memory (Ritual Fossilization):**  
Because *“mo chroí”* was used in songs, prayers, and expressions of love, its meaning stayed stable even as sounds drifted.
