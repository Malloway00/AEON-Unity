# 🐾 AEON Educational Showcase — Felis *domesticus* Semiotic Drift (2025–3000)
**Mode:** Forward Drift + Cross-Species Alignment
**Focus:** Cat–human pidgin formation across smart-collar, neural-comms, and ritual play modules
**Modules engaged:** 02_Prosody Mapping · 04_Phoneme Drift · 06_Semantic Coherence · 10_Symbolic Router · 14_Corpus Tagging · 18_Empathy Vectors

## 🧭 Story So Far
- **2025:** Shelter pilot program equips rescues with tone-detecting collars translating purr-patterns to emoji.
- **2070:** Companion AI "MIU" standardises 12-tone meow syllabary for veterinary triage.
- **2300:** Urban cat collectives co-create ritual paw glyphs; households adopt them as family charms.
- **3000:** "Neren" pidgin blends human sign tokens, tonal chirps, and scent markers; used for interspecies councils.

AEON captures how technology, empathy training, and ritual cohabitation gradually convert instinctive signals into a shared language.

## 🐱 Communication Ladder

| Era | Shared Phrase | Human Delivery | Feline Response | Meaning | Intelligibility |
|-----|---------------|----------------|-----------------|---------|-----------------|
| Collar Pilot (2030) | `: )` | Gentle vowel coo [oː] + smile | Relaxed tail sway | "All safe" | 0.68 |
| MIU Rollout (2090) | `miu-chan` | Rising trill [miuː tʃan] | Shoulder bump, high trill | "Follow me" | 0.74 |
| Glyph Age (2400) | `paw ∴ sun` | Three-point paw tap + hum [ŋɔ̃] | Sand-traced spiral | "Sunroom time" | 0.82 |
| Neren Council (3000) | `*lin aur*` | Hand circle + nasal glide [lin au̯ɾ] + lavender scent | Purr-click cadence [pʰɾk] | "Share feelings" | 0.88 |

## 💡 Teaching Prompts
- Compare feline prosody charts with human vowel triangles to discuss perceptual overlap.
- Roleplay "caretaker" and "companion" using tactile glyphs; track comprehension scores.
- Connect empathy vectors to trauma-informed communication lessons.
