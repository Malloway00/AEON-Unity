# Felis domesticus Semiotic Drift (2025–3000)

## Scenario

Simulate the emergence of a cat-human communication pidgin over the next millennium:

**Parameters:**
- **Starting point:** 2025, cats and humans have lived together for 10,000 years but no shared language
- **Evolutionary pressure:** Cats develop enhanced cognitive abilities through selective breeding and neural augmentation (speculative future tech)
- **Timeline:** 2025 → 3000 (975 years of co-evolution)
- **Goal:** Model how cats might develop proto-linguistic capabilities and how humans would adapt

---

## Focus Areas

### 1. Cat Phonological Constraints

- Limited vocal tract (no labial consonants like /p/, /b/, /m/)
- Heavy use of vowels, fricatives, and trills
- Integration of non-vocal communication (tail position, ear orientation)

### 2. Semantic Domains Cats Would Prioritize

- Territory negotiation ("this sunny spot is mine")
- Food requests (beyond simple meowing)
- Time-based concepts ("feed me now" vs. "I will nap later")
- Social bonding (affection, play, grooming requests)

### 3. Human Adaptation

- Simplification of grammar for cat comprehension
- Adoption of gestural elements
- Creation of hybrid pidgin vocabulary

## Phonological Inventory

### Cat-Possible Phonemes

**Vowels:** /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/  
**Consonants:** /h/, /k/, /g/, /r/, /t/, /n/, /s/, /z/  
**Trills:** Strong rolling /r/  
**Limited:** No labials, soft consonants

### Human Adaptation Layer

- Simplified grammar
- High-context gestural communication
- Tonal/pitch variations

## Sample Pidgin Phrases

### Territory/Space Domain
```
"har-kii"
= "my sunspot, stay away"
[territorial claim + spatial boundary]
```

### Food Request
```
"zrru-na-ki"
= "hungry now, feed me"
[urgent tone + temporal marker]
```

### Social Bonding
```
"rro-sa"
= "play with me, positive interaction"
[invitation + emotional valence]
```

## Evolutionary Mechanics

- Neurological co-adaptation
- Gestural-sonic hybrid communication
- Increasing semantic complexity
- Selective breeding for communication capacity

## Plausibility Scores

- **Phonological Drift:** 0.87
- **Morphological Erosion:** 0.73
- **Communication Reconstruction Confidence:** 0.81

## Comparative Reflex Table

| Species           | Form      | IPA       | Meaning               | Plausibility |
|-------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------|--------------|
| Proto-Feline      | zrru-na   | /zru.na/  | "urgent need"         | 0.92         |
| Human Adaptation  | har-kii   | /har.ki/  | "territorial claim"   | 0.85         |
| Hybrid Pidgin     | rro-sa    | /ro.sa/   | "social bonding"      | 0.79         |
